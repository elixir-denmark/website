ELIXIR Denmark is a member of [ELIXIR](https://elixir-europe.org/), an intergovernmental organisation that coordinates, integrates and sustains bioinformatics resources across its member states and enables users in academia and industry to access vital data, tools, standards, compute and training services for their research. ELIXIR Denmark is established in a partnership between six Danish Universities and institutes. 

Currently, ELIXIR Denmark leads the community-driven development of the ELIXIR core service [bio.tools](_pages/services.md#biotools).
