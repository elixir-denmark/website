ELIXIR Denmark, which is established in a partnership between Danish Universities, is a member of [ELIXIR](https://elixir-europe.org/), an intergovernmental organisation that coordinates, integrates and sustains bioinformatics resources across its member states and enables users in academia and industry to access vital data, tools, standards, compute and training services for their research. 


ELIXIR Denmark leads the community-driven development of the ELIXIR core service [bio.tools](https://bio.tools/). This Tools and Data Services Registry provides essential scientific and technical information about analytical tools and data services for bioinformatics. The portal is freely accessible and available for  registering resources, and nurtures the need for finding, accessing and using bio-molecular databases and using interoperable software tools for data analysis and interpretation.
