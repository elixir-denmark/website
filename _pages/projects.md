## ELIXIR Tools and Data Services Registry

The Registry serves as a gateway to databases and tools for Life Science. It was designed with focus on both
discovery and integration of life science resources and a flexible web interface as well as programmatic access.

Use the [bio.tools portal](https://bio.tools/) to search for, and/or register resources in the Registry.

### Overview

## BioGLUE Unified Danish ELIXIRT infrastructure 

Nowadays, biological data originates from many different experimental techniques and analytical platforms, each contributing in a unique way to the complex landscape of biomedical science. The resulting, new and valuable, data often comes in formats that are incompatible or difficult to integrate with existing software tools, thus making it nearly impossible to connect to current knowledge and gain new insights. This heterogeneity of data formats and standards results in laborious manual processing, which is both time consuming and prone to errors. It does not only distract bioinformaticians from focusing on the actual data analysis and interpretation but can be a big hurdle for researchers without bioinformatics skills.  

The goal of the BioGLUE project is to provide a unified Danish infrastructure for seamless data and tool interoperability. The project will align with the European ELIXIR Infrastructure and enable fully functional data analysis workflows for a wide range of researchers, both nationally and internationally. This will be accomplished with the help of large language models, which can be utilized for automated data conversion and integration, or least to facilitate the harmonization of data from different sources. Use cases will include data for non-coding RNA and CRISPR gene editing, which presents the challenge of combining RNA structures with high-throughput RNA structure probing. Further work will involve the integration with genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metagenomics data.
