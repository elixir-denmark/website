The life science community has an increasing need for accessing bio-molecular databases, integrating data and using interoperable tools for data analysis and interpretation.

ELIXIR Denmark leads the community-driven development of the ELIXIR Tools and Data Services Registry, namely the [bio.tools portal](https://bio.tools/) that provides essential scientific and technical information about analytical tools and data services for bioinformatics. The portal is freely accessible and available for  registering resources.

ELIXIR Denmark, which is established in a partnership between Danish Universities, is a member of [ELIXIR](https://elixir-europe.org/), an intergovernmental organisation that brings together life science resources from across Europe.
