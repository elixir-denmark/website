## Novo Nordisk Foundation awards BioGLUE grant to HoN Jan Gorodkin (20 Sept 2024)

The Novo Nordisk Foundation granted the infrastructure project BioGLUE and secured all funds for Denmark's membership in ELIXIR for the coming years. BioGLUE will tackle a common challenge in bioinformatics, the time-consuming task of gluing together different data formats. Instead of manual effort, the aim of BioGLUE is to create a digital infrastructure for automatic, seamless integration of various biological data using large language models.
