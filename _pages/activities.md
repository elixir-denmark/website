# ELIXIR Denmark Activities

## ELIXIR Tools and Data Services Registry

The Registry serves as a gateway to databases and tools for Life Science. It was designed with focus on both
discovery and integration of life science resources and a flexible web interface as well as programmatic access.

Use the [bio.tools portal](https://bio.tools/) to search for, and/or register resources in the Registry.
