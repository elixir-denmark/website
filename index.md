ELIXIR Denmark is a member of [ELIXIR](https://elixir-europe.org/), an intergovernmental organisation that coordinates, integrates and sustains bioinformatics resources across its member states and enables users in academia and industry to access vital data, tools, standards, compute and training services for their research. ELIXIR Denmark is established in a partnership between six Danish Universities and institutes. 

Currently, ELIXIR Denmark leads the community-driven development of the ELIXIR core service [bio.tools](https://bio.tools/). This Tools and Data Services Registry provides essential scientific and technical information about analytical tools and data services for bioinformatics. The portal is freely accessible and available for  registering resources, and nurtures the need for finding, accessing and using bio-molecular databases and using interoperable software tools for data analysis and interpretation.

ELIXIR Denmark has recently initiated the BioGLUE project, whose goal is to provide a unified Danish infrastructure for seamless data interoperability. The project will align with the European ELIXIR Infrastructure and utilize the extensive tools registry already in place to enable fully functional data analysis workflows for a wide range of researchers, both nationally and internationally. BioGLUE and ELIXIR Denmark are supported by the Novo Nordisk Foundation.
